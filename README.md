# CDDA_Nonperisable_Overhaul

This mod has a very simple premise: a general overhaul of spoilage for food that is obstinately non-perisable. Main effect is reverting the spoilage times added to a broad swath of shelf-stable food. Reasons why include:

1. Shelf lives seem to be based on worst-case scenariods, which is ONLY realistic if you give players the ability to storer the food in proper containers (which did not happen).
2. Conversion of half-rotten ingredients into half-rotten food is blind to whether an individual type of food would be sertilized in the process, and whether this therefore SHOULD affect the rot timer of the output.
3. Causes inventory clutter and other detriments to quality of life.

On top of that, this mod also pre-emptively applies this to several items that:
1. Might get this change applied in the future when they shouldn't.
2. Have traditionally been perishible in-game but might be subject to unexpepected behavior at some point due to it (i.e. fermentation seems to preclude spoiling but only one brewable item is perishable, so abnormal behavior might arise if changes to fermentation neglect the lone exception).
3. Might warrant it for balancing reasons or misc reasons.
